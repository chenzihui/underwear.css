# What is this?
------------------------------

A small, customizable CSS library that provides a minimal set of styles designed to help you build the skeleton of your web application quickly.

CSS is authored as closely as possible to the Object Oriented CSS principles as advocated by Nicole Sullivan i.e. [@stubbornella](http://twitter.com/stubbonella).

## Yet another CSS library?

Now, don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of what's out there at the moment and in fact, I use Bootstrap regularly both at work as well as for my personal projects.

But my problem is that I've always ended up overwriting the default Bootstrap styles which leaves me with quite a bloated CSS file (with overwritten styles and unused classes).

And so, after reading on the "Vanilla Web Diet" as proposed by [@codepo8](http://twitter.com/codepo8), I've decided to take a stab at creating a minimal set of CSS rules that I can use to kickstart my web application.

## What's included?
------------------------------

- Grid (12 column, fixed width)
- Typography (Based on a [modularscale](http://modularscale.com))
- Buttons
- Lists
- Forms
- Generic Helpers

## How do I use it?
------------------------------

I've tried to keep the naming conventions to be as humanly understandable at first glance, but it is recommendation that you read through the source and customize it (especially the parts on colors) to your needs.

This should be used in conjunction to the excellent [normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css).

## Roadmap
------------------------------

- Fluid grid
- Porting it over to LESS / Sass to provide more modularity
